python-chord
============

Python **Chord** implementation from paper available [here](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf).

Currently supports the sequential addition of peers into the network.

Finger tables are consistent, key lookup is also consistent.

**DISCLAIMER**
Project for fun to learn about DHT's, not intended to be used in real life.
